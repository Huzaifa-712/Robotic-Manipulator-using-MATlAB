# Robotic-Manipulator-using-MATLAB

I designed a robotics manipulator using matlab with visuals that were incorporated from SolidWorks.
This project presents the design and implementation of a 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) industrial robotic manipulator, developed in MATLAB with an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI). The manipulator replicates the movement and control of an industrial robot arm, focusing on joint motion, position computation, force analysis, and workspace mapping for educational and research applications.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
